Dinosaurs roamed the Earth millions of years ago, dominating the landscapes with their colossal size. The Tyrannosaurus Rex, known for its massive teeth and powerful bite, was one of the most feared predators. Herbivores like the Brontosaurus grazed on high tree leaves, their long necks reaching where others could not. Triceratops, with their distinctive three-horned face, roamed in herds for protection against predators. Fossils discovered worldwide give us clues about their diverse ecosystems and behaviors. Scientists continue to study these magnificent creatures, uncovering secrets of their extinction and life cycles. The fascination with dinosaurs is evident in museums, where replicas and skeletons attract visitors of all ages.
